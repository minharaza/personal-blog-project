# Personal-blog-project
Hello everyone!

My goal with this project is to learn about front end and UX/UI! Here's my attempt at learning in the form of a blog! I am attempting to use Angular framework along with Bulma open source framework to make CSS styling and HTML components a little less scary.

I am also attempting to walk myself through the UX/UI design process, as if I was working on a real industry site. 

## Some other goals for myself:
* Learn UX/UI design concepts and *attempt* to implement them into this website
* Create my own art for the website - I'm trying to work on my design skills alongside my computer science skills!
* Better understand HTML and front end development
* Don't give up!
* And most importantly - Have fun learning! <3

## Preliminary Ideas
I decided on attempting at a personal blog. This will not only give me the freedom to excercise different types of creativity, but also I can play with different components as I go! I do not have a rigid idea of what will go on here, but I'm confident as I work through this design process I will get a better, more concrete idea of what this may look like.

Stay tuned for more!
